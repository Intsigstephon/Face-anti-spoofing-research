        Improving Face Anti-Spoofing by 3D Virtual Synthesis


1. Learn Convolutional Neural Network for Face Anti-Spoofing
   highlight: 
   a) first use cnn to solve face anti-spoofing problem
   b) some trick preprocess
   c) over 70% relative decrease of Half Total Error Rate (HTER) on CASIA [36] and REPLAY-ATTACK
   d) better generalization ability
   
2. Face anti-spoofing based on color texture analysis
